## Case Testing

In the following folders, selected test cases are available, here is a concise explanation of the layout:


### Part B
#### The tests in /partb change with the following values

n = 4, 16, 64, 128

omega  = 1, 5

rho max = 2, 6, 12

tolerance = 1e-10

### Part D
#### The tests in /partd change with the following values

n = 4, 16, 64, 128

omega  = 1, 3, 7, 11

rho max = 2, 6, 36, 128

tolerance = 1e-10


### Part E
#### The tests in /parte change with the following values

n = 4, 16, 64, 128

omega  = 0.01, 0.5, 1.0, 5.0
