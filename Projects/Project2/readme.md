## How to run codebase

This program allows the user to input n (for n x n matrix), omega, rho max, and convergence tolerance to solve Eigenvalue problems from the equations of a buckling beam to Schroedinger\'s equation


### User Input for n, omega, rho max, and solution tolerance to solve their choice of matrix pertaining to this situation.
```
python main.py
```

### To run selected test cases (as requested by prompt)
```
python testing.py
```

All data will be available in /results
